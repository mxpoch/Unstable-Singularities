    "We are looking for solutions of the profile chosen by Lou. Hou (2014). Starting with a single, purely rotating eddy in a cylinder, they demonstrated evidence of a singularity forming in finite-time. The initial profile required an odd function in the z-direction of the cylinder.\n",

    "They claimed that as the simulation progressed, the singularity will become asymptotically self-similar."
